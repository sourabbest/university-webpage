        <h1>University systems in india</h1>
      <p> The higher education system in India has grown in a remarkable way, particularly in the
post-independence period, to become one of the largest system of its kind in the world.
However, the system has many issues of concern at present, like financing and
management including access, equity and relevance, reorientation of programmes by
laying emphasis on health consciousness, values and ethics and quality of higher
education together with the assessment of institutions and their accreditation. These
issues are important for the country, as it is now engaged in the use of higher education
as a powerful tool to build a knowledge-based information society of the 21st Century.
Recognizing the above and the basic fact, that the Universities have to perform multiple
roles, like creating new knowledge, acquiring new capabilities and producing an
intelligent human resource pool, through challenging teaching, research and extension
activities so as to balance both the need and the demand, the University Grants
commission (UGC) had initiated nation wise discussion on the said issues during its
Golden Jubilee Year, 2003. Eleven Universities located in different regions of the were
assigned the task of conducting Seminars on identified topics in the above areas, during
Aug-Nov., 2003 and come out with their Reports and Recommendations.
An Editorial Committee was constituted by UGC to consider the outcome of these
Seminars and compile them suitably so that an appropriate publication can be brought out
for the use of UGC, higher education planners and the University system itself. I am glad
that this publication, Higher Education in India: Issues, Concerns and New Directions is
a result of these efforts.
I would like to place on record our deep sense of appreciation to the eleven Universities
to whom the Seminars were assigned, for their timely actions of planning/coordinating
the Seminars and their pains taking work in prepar9ng the detailed proceedings, and to
the learned / experienced resource persons and delegates for keen interest and active
participation in the deliberations.

I would also like to thank the Editorial Committee for compiling and editing the reports
received from the Universities and bringing out this useful publication in time. I am
quite certain that this publication will help in giving a new direction aimed at the 21st
century expectations to the Indian higher education system and accelerate its pace of
development to meet the needs and aspirations of the society at large.</p>

                                


  <h1>Types of university</h1>

        <h4>1. IITs </h4>
        <p>The Indian Institutes of Technology (popularly known as the IITs) are institutions of national importance established through an Act of Parliament for fostering excellence in education. There are fifteen IITs at present, located in Bhubaneswar, Bombay (Mumbai), Delhi, Gandhinagar, Guwahati, Hyderabad, Indore, Kanpur, Kharagpur, Madras (Chennai), Mandi, Patna, Ropar, Jodhpur and Roorkee. Over the years IITs have created world class educational platforms dynamically sustained through internationally recognized research based on excellent infrastructural facilities. The faculty and alumni of IITs continue making a huge impact in all sectors of society, both in India and abroad. Banaras Hindu University (IT-BHU, now known as IIT-BHU since 2012), Varanasi and Indian School of Mines (ISM), Dhanbad, are amongst the oldest institutions in India and are known for their immense contributions towards society at large and for science and technology in particular.

The primary objectives behind such institutions are to:

Build a solid foundation of scientific and technical knowledge and thus to prepare competent and motivated engineers and scientists.
Create environment for freedom of thought, cultivate vision, encourage growth, develop personality and self- discipline for pursuit of excellence.
Kindle entrepreneurial streak.
All of the above help to prepare the students admitted to these institutions for successful professional and social lives. Today, alumni of these institutions occupy key positions in industry and academia in India and abroad.

Each institute has well-equipped modern laboratories, state-of-the-art computer network and well stocked technical library. Teaching methods rely on direct personal contact between the teachers and the students and the use of traditional and modern instructional techniques. Students live in a pleasant and intellectually stimulating environment with people having similar goals and aspirations, which is an exciting and unique experience.

Credit-based academic programmes offer flexibility to students to progress at their own pace. A minimum level of performance is necessary for satisfactory progress. The medium of instruction is English. These institutions offer courses leading to Bachelor's degree in a number of engineering, technological and scientific disciplines. M.Sc. Integrated courses in pure and applied sciences and M.Tech. Integrated courses in a few disciplines are also offered by some of these Institutions. In addition, some IITs offer Dual-Degree M.Tech. programmes. The admissions to the Undergraduate Programmes at these institutions for all Indian and Foreign nationals are made through the Joint Entrance Examination (JEE).

IIT Bhuvaneshwar, IIT Gandhinagar, IIT Hyderabad, IIT Rajasthan, IIT Patna, IIT Punjab joined the elite list of the below seven premier technology institutions of the country and started operations in the year 2008. IIT Indore, IIT Mandi commenced their operations from the academic year 2009-2010.

       <h4>2. NITs</h4>
       The National Institutes of Technology (NITs): are a group of higher education engineering institutes in India. Comprising thirty autonomous institutes, they are located in one each major state/territory of India. On their inception decades ago, all NITs were referred to as Regional Engineering Colleges (RECs) and were governed by their respective state governments. A parliamentary legislation in 2002 brought them under the direct purview of India's federal government. In 2007, through legislation, the Indian government declared these schools as Institutes of National Importance at par with the Indian Institutes of Technology.

NITs were found to promote regional diversity and multi-cultural understanding in India. Therefore, in the NIT school system, 50% of the student population in each batch is drawn from the respective state of the NIT and the other 50% is drawn from the rest of India on a common merit list. This is different than the Indian Institutes of Technology or IITs - another prominent engineering school system in India. An IIT need not accept specified number of students from any region of India as the IIT admission criteria is based only on the performance of a student in an entrance examination.

NITs offer degree courses at bachelors, masters, and doctorate levels in various branches of engineering and technology. Various nationwide college surveys rate most of the NITs over other colleges in India, except for the IITs and a few other institutions. NITs function autonomously, similarly to IITs, sharing only entrance tests. The autonomy enables the NITs to set up their own curriculum, thereby making it easier to adapt to changing industry requirements. The admissions to the Undergraduate Programmes at these institutions for all Indian and Foreign nationals are made through the Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) Main.

<h4>3. IISERs </h4>
    
    
    Indian Institutes of Science Education and Research (IISERs) are a group of premier public research institutions in India. The institutes were established by the Government of India through the Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD) to provide collegiate education in basic sciences coupled with research at the undergraduate level. The institutes were formally established by the Parliament of India through the National Institutes of Technology, Science Education and Research (Amendment) Act, 2010 (an amendment to the National Institutes of Technology Act, 2007). Seven IISERs have been established across the country, namely IISER Kolkata in West Bengal, IISER Pune in Maharashtra, IISER Mohali in Punjab, IISER Bhopal in Madhya Pradesh, IISER Thiruvananthapuram in Kerala, IISER Tirupati in Andhra Pradesh, and IISER Berhampur in Odisha. All IISERs were declared as Institutes of National Importance by the Parliament of India in 2012, to promote them as leading institutions in the country in the field of basic sciences along with its sister institutes like Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore and National Institute of Science Education and Research, Bhubaneswar. The financial outlay for each IISER is around ₹5 billion (US$63 million) for the first five years of establishment.
