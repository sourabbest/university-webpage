<h1>State university in india</h1>
<p>In India, state universities are run and funded by the state government of each of the states of India.
    Following the adoption of the Constitution of India in 1950, education became a state responsibility. 
    Following a constitutional change in 1976,it became a joint responsibility of the states and the central government. <br>
    [1] As of 17 May 2021, the UGC lists 426 state universities. <br>
    [2] Section 12 (B) of the UGC Act of 1956 also grants the UGC the right to "allocate and disburse, out of the Fund of the Commission, grants to Universities...". <br>
    [3] As such, the UGC categorizes state universities as either "declared fit to receive Central/UGC assistance under Section 12 <br>
    (B) of the UGC Actâ€“1956", or not, and notes this status at the lists published.[2] Updates to these declarations are done in meetings of the UGC and published in the minutes. <br>
    [4] The latest list, published by the UGC on 17 May 2021, lists 252 universities fit to receive Central/UGC assistance. <br> </p>
